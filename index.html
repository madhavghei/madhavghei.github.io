        <strong>Who is the expected user? </strong> The ideal user is a stage performer, ideally someone incorporating the mask as a part of a greater overall piece, such as interpretive dance, or a one-man band (using their hands for percussion instruments, for example, and using their face for the melody). Dancers also frequently use their facial expressions to add to their performance. Now, with the mask being able to map those facial expressions into musical output, they will no longer be just visual additions to the performance, but aural ones as well. <br> <br>

		<strong> Expected use case:</strong> Stage performance. It will complement an existing dance / instrumental performance by transmitting facial expressions into music. <br> <br>

		<strong> How is the instrument played? What kinds of sounds are produced? </strong> The instrument is played by biting down and chewing on a force sensor, which controls the volume of the generated sound. The pitch of the sound is controlled by moving one's chin along a soft potentiometer attached to the inside of the mask, directly under the chin. The sound produced is a sine wave, and depending on the amount of pressure applied to the force sensor (with one's bite) the sine wave undergoes a proportionate amount of distortion.

        <strong> How is it built? What software and hardware are used? </strong> I built this instrument using a Max MSP patch to interpret the sensor readings and link them to their corresponding sound parameter controls (i.e., the force sensor mapped to volume and the soft potentiometer to pitch). In terms of hardware, apart from the two sensors I used, I connected them to the software using an Arduino Uno and a breadboard. I attached the sensors to a Mexican Luchador mask I bought on Amazon for approximately $20.

        <strong> What lessons did I learn from making this instrument? What might I improve on in future iterations? </strong> I learned that building a new instrument requires a lot of creativity. I had to think a lot about existing instruments and what affordances they gave musicians, and what they made hard. Because I was making an instrument that had a physical component, I also had to think about the human body and the ways in which existing instruments have been able to take advantage of the physical design of the body, as well as which paths remained relatively unexplored. I learned that despite your testing and planning, playing the instrument might taken on a completely different form once completed, and that's okay. For future iterations of this instrument, I would like to map additional mouth-based movements to musical parameters, such that the instrument can be played in deeper and more musicall complex ways. I would ideally like it to be completely hands-free, and thus able to augment other musical or dance-based actions, and it would probably be most effective in that regard if it were to be wireless, or completely self-powered — that is, without an Arduino.
